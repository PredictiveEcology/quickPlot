Title: A System of Plotting Optimized for Speed and Modularity
Description: A high-level plotting system, built using 'grid' graphics, that is
    optimized for speed and modularity. This has great utility for quick
    visualizations when testing code, with the key benefit that visualizations
    are updated independently of one another.
    The suggested package 'fastshp' can be installed with e.g.,
    'install.packages("fastshp", repos = "https://PredictiveEcology.r-universe.dev")'.
