Title: A System of Plotting Optimized for Speed and Modularity
Description: A high-level plotting system, compatible with `ggplot2` objects, 
    maps from `sf`, `terra`, `raster`, `sp`. It is built primarily on the 
    'grid' package. The objective of the package is to provide a plotting system 
    that is built for speed and modularity. This is useful for quick visualizations 
    when testing code and for plotting multiple figures to the same device from 
    independent sources that may be independent of one another (i.e., different 
    function or modules the create the visualizations).  The suggested package 
    'fastshp' can be installed from the repository 
    (<https://PredictiveEcology.r-universe.dev>).
