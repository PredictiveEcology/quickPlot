\title{The \code{quickPlot} package}
\description{
A high-level plotting system, built using 'grid' graphics, that is optimized
for speed and modularity. This has great utility for quick visualizations
when testing code, with the key benefit that visualizations are updated
independently of one another.
}
\note{
The suggested package \pkg{fastshp} can be installed with
\code{install.packages("fastshp", repos = "https://rforge.net", type = "source")}.
